Money, get away.
Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream.
Think I'll buy me a football team.

Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set.
And I think I need a Learjet.
Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.

Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away.

"Working Class Hero".
As soon as you're born they make you feel small.
By giving you no time instead of it all.
'Til the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school.
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool.
'Til you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years.
Then they expect you to pick a career.
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
Keep you doped with religion, and sex, and T.V.
And you think you're so clever and classless and free.
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
There's room at the top they are telling you still.
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill.
If you want to be like the folks on the hill.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
If you want to be a hero well just follow me.
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

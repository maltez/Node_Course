    <p>In the flowing mode, data can actually be lost if no consumers are available to handle it.
        This is why, when we
        have a readable stream in flowing mode, we need a data event handler. In fact, just adding a data event handler
        switches a paused stream into flowing mode and removing the data event handler switches the stream back to
        paused mode. Some of this is done for backward compatibility with the older Node streams interfacTo manually
        switch between these two stream modes, yo</p>
